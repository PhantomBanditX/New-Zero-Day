# New Zero-Day

## 1. Preparation

### Scenario

A recently discovered ransomware variant called `PwnCrypt` has been making headlines for its use of a PowerShell-based payload to encrypt files on compromised systems. The malware employs AES-256 encryption and focuses on specific folders, including `C:\Users\Public\Desktop`. Once encrypted, files are renamed with the original extension followed by `.pwncrypt`.

**Description:**

- The security program is immature and lacks basic user training.
- Newly discovered ransomware may have already entered the corporate network.

**Task:**

- Examine the potential spread of the new ransomware strain into the corporate network.

**Goal:**

- Uncover evidence of ransomware activity and trace its movement between devices.

### Components, Tools, and Technologies Employed

- **Cloud Environment:** Microsoft Azure (VM-Windows target machine)
- **Threat Detection Platform:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)

## 2. Detection & Analysis

### **Connection Failure Review**

Inspected file system activity for pwncrypt IoCs.
<br><br>
```kql
let PatientZero  = "cyberclaw-vm";
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == PatientZero 
| where FileName contains "pwncrypt"
| order by Timestamp desc  
```

<br><br>
Findings: Files created on Desktop, then renamed in Temp within one second.

---

### **Network Forensics**

Reviewed process activity for pwncrypt-related execution.
<br><br>
```kql
let PatientZero  = "cyberclaw-vm";
let SpecificTime = datetime(2026-04-26T01:13:33.1636981Z);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between ((SpecificTime - 5m) .. (SpecificTime + 5m))
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "pwncrypt" or FolderPath contains "pwncrypt"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine 
```

#### `Timestamp captured: 2026-04-26T01:13:33.1636981Z`

Findings: The attack chain: `cmd.exe` launched `powershell.exe` with execution policy bypass to run `C:\programdata\pwncrypt.ps1`, confirming the ransomware's delivery mechanism.

## 3. Response

To contain the threat and prevent further encryption, take the following actions:

<br><br>

- Immediately isolate `cyberclaw-vm` from the network to prevent lateral movement or further malicious activity.
- Terminate any active `powershell.exe` processes initiated by `cmd.exe`, as they are tied to the malicious execution chain.
- Remove `C:\ProgramData\pwncrypt.ps1` and all related ransomware artifacts from the system.
- Reimage or rebuild `cyberclaw-vm` to a **known-good baseline** to ensure full eradication and integrity restoration.


---

## 4. Documentation
Findings:

- Ransomware execution confirmed via PowerShell invocation from command shell.
- File staging behavior observed in Desktop and Temp directories.
- Execution chain validated through correlated process and file telemetry.
- System compromise contained and remediated through isolation and reimaging.
  
---

## 5. Improvement

- Implement PowerShell Security Controls
- Deploy Application Control (AppLocker or WDAC)
- Implement Network Segmentation & Asset Hygiene
- Establish Basic User Awareness Training

## 🧾Summary                   
A ransomware variant, **PwnCrypt**, was detected on the host `cyberclaw-vm` using a PowerShell-based payload that encrypted files located in `C:\Users\Public\Desktop`. The investigation revealed files being created on the Desktop and rapidly renamed in the Temp directory with the `.pwncrypt` extension. Telemetry also showed `cmd.exe` launching `powershell.exe` with the **-ExecutionPolicy Bypass** flag to execute a script from `C:\ProgramData\pwncrypt.ps1`. The affected system was immediately isolated, malicious artifacts were removed, and the host was reimaged to restore a clean state.
